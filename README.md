# Employee Tracker 

## Description

In this unit we were introduced to CMS (Content Management Systems) and were tasked to create a way for company's to create and view their list of departments, the different roles within the departments, the employees, their managers, and how to update that information if necessary using the command line and also while working with node, inquirer, and MYSQL. 

The reason why I made this Logo Generator was because as a Full-Stack Developer, I need to learn as many skills as I can and this homework assignment allowed me to work with node, inquirer, and MYSQL simultaneously which poses many different challenges and lessons along the way.

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application

WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

WHEN I choose to view all employees

WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role

## Usage

Users can use this program by opening this file in their VS and using the server.js file to open up their terminal. Once the terminal has been opened, they will type "npm i -y" in their terminal and once that's complete they will type node server which will render the prompts. The user will go through with answering every question that is prompted to them including adding departments, roles, employees, or updating the roles of any current employees. 

In the future I would like to be able to add more prompts such as updating employees, departments, salaries etc
